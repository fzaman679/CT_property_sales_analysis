								<p>The demand for properties in Connecticut have been increasing over the last couple of years. As the hypothesis states, <b>the closer you are to NYC, the higher the demand is due to the income</b>.  This analysis responds to the following questions:
									<ul>
										<li>Number of sales by Year</li>
										<li>Number of sales by City</li>
										<li>Unemployment Rate by Year</li>
										<li>Unemployment Rate during pandemic </li>
										<li>Median Household Income by Year per county</li>
										<li>Fairfield County Median Household Income vs CT Median Household Income </li>

								<h3 class="subtitle">As stated on the introduction, this page will answer the questions visually.</h3>

								<img class="graph" src="images/sales_by_year.png" alt="">
								<p>In the last two years number of sales has decreased dramatically, why?</p>
								<img class="graph" src="images/unemployment_rate.png" alt="">
								<p>During the last two years there has been a pandemic.  This massive event caused a lockdown which caused many people to stay home and spend conservatively. Due to this event, there is a correlation between the unemployment rates and the number of houses sold. Now let us take a look at the unemployment rate during last two years by month. </p>

								<img class="graph" src="images/unemployment_rate_last_two_years.png" alt="">
								<p>The unemployment rate skyrocketed since the pandemic event that began in March 2020.  Due to this many companies had a reduced workforce and suffered losses in profits and capital.</p>
								
								<img class="graph" src="images/sales_by_city.png" alt="">
								<p>This graph shows that the most popular areas to buy a house was in Fairfield County which accounts for seven out of ten cities that have train station (Metro North) that is accesible and will get them to NYC timely. </p>
								
								<img class="graph-comparison1" src="images/income_by_county.png" alt="">
								<p>In Fairfield County, the median income has increased over the years in comparison to other counties. There has been a migration of people from NY that have moved to CT.  </p>
								

								<img class="graph-comparison2" src="images/fairfield_county_vs_ct_state.png" alt="">
								<p>Below there is a chart that shows type of properties sold. According to the chart, many people prefer to buy single family homes because of privacy and cost. </p>

							<p> This chart shows that the type of properties sold in Fairfield County were mainly single family homes.  Fairfield County is less than 100km/62 miles from New York City.  My hypothesis is correct.</p>
							
							<p> <b> We will focus on single family homes in Top 5 cities listed below </b> </p>	
								<ul>
									<li>Stamford</li>
									<li>Bridgeport</li>
									<li>Norwalk</li>
									<li>Fairfield</li>
									<li>Stratford</li>
								</ul>
